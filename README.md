## Nowcasting regional unemployment rates in Denmark
### - A machine learning approach with novel data

We develop a machine learning approach to nowcasting regional unemployment rates that allows for real-time nowcasting within the publication lag period. We rely on novel data sources such as online search term intensity from Google Trends and job market indicators from Jobindex that are available in real time.
By combining various machine learning techniques with the novel data sources, we obtain
nowcasts for the monthly unemployment rates of the Danish regions from 2011-2019, and nowcasts for the quarterly unemployment rates of the Swedish regions from 2011- 2019. By testing various machine learning algorithms against different benchmark time series models for both countries, we find that the machine learning algorithms provides, at best, modest improvements the nowcasts of the unemployment rates â€“ and we also analyse and discuss under which conditions machine learning has the most potential for improving nowcasts.
